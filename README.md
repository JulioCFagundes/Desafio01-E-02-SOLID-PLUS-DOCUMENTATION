# Desafio01-E-02-SOLID-PLUS-DOCUMENTATION
Rocketseat course's first and second challenge of Chapter two about NodeJS. 
This API makes a user's repository. 
You can create new users, search for a user by id, turn a user admin and only admins have access to the full list of users.
You can also see the documentation when the server is on: http://localhost:3333/api-docs/
To run the server you must type: "yarn dev" on your repository with VSCODE or any environment you like.
